### US-002: Extend analysis schema to include Parties and Obligations
Status: in_progress
Depends on: None

Description:
As a user, I want parties and obligations extracted from analyses so those sections can be populated consistently.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Update analysis prompt and schema to include obligations[] and parties[] in resultJson
- [ ] Ensure analysis parsing tolerates missing fields by defaulting to empty arrays
- [ ] Persist obligations and parties on analysis records in latestAnalysis/analyses
- [ ] Example: analysis result includes two parties and three obligations that are stored in resultJson
- [ ] Negative case: model returns no parties/obligations -> analysis still completes and defaults to empty arrays

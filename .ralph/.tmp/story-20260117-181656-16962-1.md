### US-001: Harden contract detail route against blank-screen failures
Status: in_progress
Depends on: None

Description:
As a user, I want the contract detail page to always render a meaningful state so that I never encounter a blank screen when opening analyzed contracts.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Add route-level error handling for /contracts/[id] to surface a friendly error view with a Back to Dashboard action
- [ ] Guard all date formatting and nested analysis access so missing/invalid fields do not throw
- [ ] Show explicit empty state guidance when analysis is absent or incomplete
- [ ] Example: a contract with no analysis renders the empty state with a clear call to action
- [ ] Negative case: /contracts/:id API returns 404 or 500 -> error state renders and the page does not blank
